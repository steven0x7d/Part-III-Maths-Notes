	\section*{Introduction}

	Lie groups and Lie algebras are important in the construction of quantum field theories which describe interactions between known particles. Gauge theories, which describe many of the interactions in the Standard Model, rely on them. After some other preliminaries, we introduce representations in terms of square matrices. The group of rotations in three-dimensional space SO(3) is covered, along with SU(2) and the connection to angular momentum. Relativistic symmetries are discussed: in particular, the Lorentz and Poincar\'e groups and quantum fields. Lie groups and Lie algebras are covered in more generality, focusing on SU(3) as a useful example. An overview of the results of the Cartan classification of simple Lie algebras is included. Finally, gauge theory is introduced.
