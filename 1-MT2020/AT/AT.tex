	\section*{Course Information}

	Algebraic Topology permeates modern pure mathematics and theoretical physics. This course will focus on (co)homology, with an emphasis on applications to the topology of manifolds. We will cover singular and cellular (co)homology; degrees of maps and cup-products; cohomology with compact supports and Poincar\'e duality; and Thom isomorphism and the Euler class. The course will not specifically assume any knowledge of algebraic topology, but will go quite fast in order to reach more interesting material, so some previous exposure to chain complexes (e.g. simplicial homology) would certainly be helpful.
	
	\section*{Pre-requisites}

	Basic topology: topological spaces, compactness and connectedness, at the level of Sutherland’s book. Some knowledge of the fundamental group would be helpful though not a requirement. Hatcher’s book and Bott and Tu’s book are especially recommended for accompanying the course, but there are many other suitable texts.

	\emph{Algebraic Topology} concerns the \emph{connectivity} properties of topological spaces.

	\begin{defi}
		A space $X$ is \emph{path-connected} if for $p,q\in X$, $\exists \gamma: [0,1] \to X$ continuous with $\gamma(0) = p, \gamma(1) = q$. 
	\end{defi}

	\begin{ex}
		$\mathbb{R}$ is path-connected; $\mathbb{R} \backslash \{0\}$ is not.
	\end{ex}

	\begin{cor}[The intermediate value theorem]
		If $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $x < y$ satisfy $f(x)<0, f(y)>0$ then $f$ takes the value 0 on $[x,y]$.
	\end{cor}

	\begin{proof}
		Otherwise, $f^{-1}(-\infty,0)\cup f^{-1}(0,\infty)$ disconnects $[x,y]$, \#. 
	\end{proof}

	\begin{defi}
		Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces. We say maps $f_0, f_1 : Y \to X$ are \emph{homotopic} if $\exists F : Y \times [0,1] \to X$ continuous such that
		\[
			F|_{Y \times \{0\}} = f_0, \qquad F|_{Y \times \{1\}} = f_1
		\]
		
		We write $f_0 \simeq f_1$ (or $f_0 \simeq_F f_1)$.
	\end{defi}
	\needfig{square}

	\begin{exer}
		(On example sheet 1) $\simeq$ is an equivalence relation on the set of maps from $Y$ to $X$.
	\end{exer}

	\begin{nt}
		$X$ is \emph{path-connected} iff every two maps $\{\text{point}\} \to X$ are homotopic.
	\end{nt}

	\begin{defi}
		$X$ is \emph{simply-connected} if every two maps $S^1 \to X$ are homotopic.
	\end{defi}

	\begin{nt}
		We often denote
		\[
			S^1 = \{z \in \mathbb{C} : \abs{z} = 1\}, \qquad S^n = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \norm{x} = 1\}
		\]
	\end{nt}

	\begin{ex}
		$\mathbb{R}^2$ is simply connected; $\mathbb{R}^2 \backslash \{0\}$ is not.
	\end{ex}
